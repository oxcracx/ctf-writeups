# CTF-Writeups 🏴‍☠️ 
Hi there! 👋 I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast who loves diving into Capture The Flag challenges — whether it's TryHackMe, OverTheWire, or any other CTF platform.

This repository documents my progress, write-ups, and learning journey as I work through various machines and challenges across different platforms.

## My goal with this repo is simple:
- Learn deeply
- Document clearly
- Grow consistently
- one challenge at a time.

#### If you're also exploring cybersecurity, binary exploitation, or CTFs, feel free to follow along. More writeups coming soon!
